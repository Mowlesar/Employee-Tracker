# Employee Tracker

## Description 

Users download the application to their computer to create tables for organizing information about their employees, including ID, roles, managers, and departments. They use the command line to edit these tables, prompted by questions about what they'd like to view or add. The application uses MYSQL, inquirer, and console tables to facilitate this. You can watch the linked walkthrough video for more details on how to use the application.
